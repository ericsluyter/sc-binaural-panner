BinauralPanner class with an accompanying GUI

![screenshot](/relative/path/to/img.jpg?raw=true "screenshot")

Currently in a *very* experimental mockup state, I would love any feedback you might have.

Requires sc3-plugins, and requires the included BParaSpace.sc to be installed in your Extensions directory.

Open basictest.scd to get started.
